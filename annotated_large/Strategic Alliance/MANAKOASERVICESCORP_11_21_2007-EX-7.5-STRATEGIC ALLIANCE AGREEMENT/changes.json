It is the sole responsibility of each party to seek independent legal advice if they have concerns or questions about the terms herein.\n\nIn the event that either party fails to perform their obligations under this agreement, the other party shall not be required to mitigate the damages resulting from such failure. However, the non-breaching party may elect to terminate the agreement and seek any available remedies through legal means if they deem it necessary.\n\nThis agreement is binding on both parties and their respective heirs, successors, and assigns, unless otherwise specified in writing by both parties.
