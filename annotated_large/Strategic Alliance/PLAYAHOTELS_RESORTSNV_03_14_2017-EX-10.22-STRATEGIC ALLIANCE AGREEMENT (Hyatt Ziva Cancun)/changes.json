Additionally, it shifts the responsibility of terminating the Master Development Agreement to both parties simultaneously with the execution of this new agreement. Lastly, it clarifies that the Terminated Franchise Agreements are being amended, not entirely replaced, which may imply a different level of change or impact compared to signing new agreements.",
