    "original": "21.13  Severability 21.13.1  If any Clause, or part of a  Clause, of this Agreement, is found by any court or administrative body of  competent jurisdiction to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable, and the  provision in question is not of a fundamental nature to the Agreement as a  whole, the legality, validity or enforceability of the remainder of this  Agreement (including the remainder of the Clause or sub Clause which contains  the relevant provision) shall not be affected.",
    "ollama_generated": "21.13a  Modification for Non-essential Provisions - Should any particular Clause, or a segment thereof, within this Agreement, deemed by a court or competent adjudicating body to be incompatible with law, invalid, or non-enforceable, and such contested provision is not vital to the integral structure of this Agreement, then the validity and enforceability of the entire remaining portions of this Agreement (encompassing the rest of the disputed Clause or sub-Clause) shall remain unaffected.\n\nThis rewritten clause aims to convey the same meaning as the original one but with a slight tweak in style and word order for a more natural flow, while still maintaining professionalism. The primary difference lies in the way the non-essential nature of the contested provision is emphasized, which may lead to a slightly softer interpretation of its impact on the overall agreement.",
