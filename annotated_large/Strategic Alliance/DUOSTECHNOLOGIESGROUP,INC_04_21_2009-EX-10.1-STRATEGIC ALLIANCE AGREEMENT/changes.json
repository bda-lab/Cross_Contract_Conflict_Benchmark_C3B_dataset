The Agreement will only become effective when all Parties involved have signed any one or combination of these counterparts. For the purposes of this Agreement, an electronically transmitted copy (facsimile) of this Agreement, including its signature pages, shall hold the same legal weight as an original.\n\nIn essence, this revised clause allows for flexibility in executing the Agreement by allowing it to be signed in multiple parts and acknowledges that digitally transmitted copies can serve as legally binding counterparts.",
