In the event that no such agreement is reached within said timeframe, this Agreement shall be deemed null and void.\n\nIn the event of any disagreement or dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the parties shall make every effort to resolve the matter amicably through good-faith negotiations. If they are unable to reach a resolution, either party may submit the matter to binding arbitration in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association then in effect.\n\nThe performance or failure to perform any obligation under this Agreement by either party shall not be considered a breach of this Agreement unless such non-performance continues for thirty (30) days after written notice has been given by one party to the other. In the event of such breach, the non-breaching party may terminate this Agreement upon providing written notice to the breaching party.\n\nSightLife Surgical, Inc. acknowledges and agrees that it shall be solely responsible for any and all sales or marketing activities conducted pursuant to this Agreement. It understands and accepts that it shall bear any and all associated costs, risks, and liabilities arising from such activities.\n\nIn the event that any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remainder of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. The invalid or unenforceable provision shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to render it valid and enforceable, or if it cannot be so modified, stricken and the parties shall negotiate in good faith to agree upon a valid and enforceable substitute provision as closely as possible reflecting the original intent of the parties.",
