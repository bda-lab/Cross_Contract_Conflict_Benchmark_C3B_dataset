If any such claim or action shall be brought against an indemnified party, and it  shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to  participate therein and, to the extent that it wishes, jointly with any other similarly notified  indemnifying party, to assume the defense thereof with counsel satisfactory to the indemnified  party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified party of its election to assume  the defense of such claim or action, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified  party under this Section 7 for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the indemnified  party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of investigation; provided however , the Remarketing Agent shall have the right to employ separate counsel to represent the  Remarketing Agent and its respective officers, employees and controlling persons who may be subject  to liability arising out of any claim in respect of which indemnity may be sought by the Remarketing Agent against the Company under this Section 7 if, in the reasonable judgment of  counsel to the Remarketing Agent it is advisable for the Remarketing Agent, its officers, employees  and controlling persons to be jointly represented by separate counsel, due to the availability of one or more legal defenses to them which are different from or additional to those available to the  indemnifying party, and in that event the reasonable fees and expenses of such separate counsel  shall be paid by the Company; provided further, that the Company shall not be liable for the fees  and expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to one local counsel in each  relevant jurisdiction) at any time for all such indemnified parties.

However, failure to notify the indemnifying party shall not absolve them from any liability under this Section 7 unless such non-disclosure has significantly impeded their ability to defend themselves, and even then, they will still be liable for any obligations outside of this Section 7. If a claim or action is brought against an indemnified party, and they choose to inform the indemnifying party, the indemnifying party will have the right, but not the obligation, to participate in the defense and may elect to do so jointly with any other similarly informed indemnifying parties, using counsel acceptable to the indemnified party. Upon the indemnifying party's request to assume the defense, they will no longer be liable for any additional legal or other expenses incurred by the indemnified party in the defense, except for reasonable costs of investigation. However, the Remarketing Agent retains the right to engage separate counsel to represent themselves and their officers, employees, and controlling persons, if, in the reasonable judgment of their counsel, such representation is advisable due to unique legal defenses available only to them. In such cases, the Company will be responsible for the fees and expenses of this separate counsel. The indemnifying party shall not be required to fund more than one separate firm of attorneys (in addition to local counsel in each relevant jurisdiction) at any given time for all indemnified parties. No indemnifying party is obligated to:\n\nThis clause maintains the original's essence but alters the obligation slightly by giving the indemnified party discretion over whether to make a claim against the indemnifying party, and by allowing the indemnifying party to participate in the defense, not obligating them to do so. It also clarifies that the indemnifying party's liability is only affected if their failure to be notified significantly impacts their ability to defend themselves, and they may still have obligations outside of this Section 7. Lastly, it specifies that the indemnifying party has the discretion to engage separate counsel if unique legal defenses are available to them, which might not be available to the indemnifying party.",

Additionally, it shifts the responsibility of potential losses or liabilities from the indemnifying party to the indemnified parties in cases where there is no settlement reached with the written consent of the indemnified parties.",

The relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether the untrue  or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material  fact relates to information supplied by the Issuers on the one hand or the Remarketing Agent on the  other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and  opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the Remarketing  Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if the amount of contributions pursuant to this  Section 7(d) were to be determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation  which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid  or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage or liability, or action  in respect thereof, referred to above in this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes  of this Section 7(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in  connection with investigating or defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the  provisions of this Section 7(d), the Remarketing Agent shall not be required to contribute any  amount in excess of the total price at which Remarketing Securities distributed in the Remarketing  exceed the amount of any damages which the Remarketing Agent has otherwise paid or become liable to  pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

The determination of fault will be contingent upon whether the misrepresentation or alleged misrepresentation of material facts, or omission or alleged omission of material information, is attributed to data provided by the Issuers or the Remarketing Agent, considering the parties' intent and their respective access to information and opportunity to rectify or prevent such misrepresentation or omission. The Company and the Remarketing Agent acknowledge that it would be inequitable for contributions under this Section 7(d) to be apportioned through proportional allocation or any other method that does not consider the equitable factors mentioned herein. Expenses reasonably incurred by an indemnified party in investigating or defending any such action or claim arising from the aforementioned events shall be considered part of the amount paid or payable by said indemnified party, for purposes of this Section 7(d).
