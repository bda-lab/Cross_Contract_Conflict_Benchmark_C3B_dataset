For clarity, singular terms encompass plural meanings, and vice versa. The term \"or\" denotes an inclusive meaning, while \"and\" signifies a conjunction. The headings used throughout this Agreement are for ease of reference only and do not serve to define, restrict, expand or alter the scope or intent of this Agreement or any of its provisions.\n\nThe phrase \"including,\" \"include,\" or \"includes\", whether preceded by \"without limitation\" or phrases of similar import, is intended to encompass all possibilities within the description provided, rather than limiting its scope.

Any reference to laws will encompass their subsequent amendments and repeals. Any reference to a person includes that individual's successors and permitted assignees.\n\nThe phrases \"herein\", \"hereof\" and \"hereunder\" refer to this Agreement as a whole, rather than any particular provision. The parties agree that the terms \"mutually agree\" or \"mutual written agreement\" do not impose an obligation on either party to engage in discussions regarding such terms unless the relevant party chooses to do so at its sole discretion.\n\nReferences to Sections, Exhibits, or Schedules pertain exclusively to those within this Agreement. The term \"days\" means calendar days and \"month\" means calendar month, unless otherwise specified. Electronic copies, files, or databases containing the relevant information are included in the meaning of \"copy\" and \"copies.\"\n\nThe phrase \"dollar,\" \"dollars,\" or \"$\" refers to U.S. dollars throughout this Agreement.
