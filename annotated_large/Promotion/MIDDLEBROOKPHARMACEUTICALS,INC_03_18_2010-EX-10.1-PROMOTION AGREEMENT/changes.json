This clause is intended to minimize the potential for costly litigation and foster a cooperative business relationship between the parties.\n\nOriginal meaning: The parties will attempt to resolve disputes through good-faith negotiations before resorting to arbitration.\n\nRewritten meaning: The parties must first engage in good-faith negotiations to resolve disputes, but only if these negotiations fail (as certified by an independent mediator) may one party then commence arbitration proceedings. This change emphasizes the necessity of negotiation and shifts the responsibility for initiating arbitration to the failure of negotiations.",
