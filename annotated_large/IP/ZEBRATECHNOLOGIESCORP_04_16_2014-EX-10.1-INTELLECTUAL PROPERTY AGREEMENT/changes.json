If as a result of the Change of Control Event such party remains a separate, independent legal entity (or is merged into another Person, where such Person was formed or created for the purpose of the Change of Control Event or where such Person is a then-current Affiliate of such party), then the license rights granted to such party under  Article II shall continue in full force and effect.

In the event of a merger or change of control involving a party (recognizing that for the purposes of this Section 6.3, a Purchaser Licensee is considered a party as is a Seller Party), hereinafter referred to as the \"Acquiring Entity\", any license rights granted under Article II to such party will be transferable to the Acquiring Entity and its Affiliates existing immediately prior to the change of control event, provided that these rights shall only extend to the products, systems, or services (including Smart Sensing Network Equipment and Public Safety LTE Smartphone Devices, as applicable) currently owned or operated by the Acquiring Entity or its Affiliates at the effective date of the change of control event. Any derivative works or natural evolutions thereof shall also be included within the scope of these license rights, subject to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(e), as applicable. In the case where the party remains a separate and independent legal entity following the change of control event, the license rights granted under Article II shall continue in full force and effect. However, if the party is absorbed by the Acquiring Entity or another entity (other than in cases where such entity was formed or created specifically for the purpose of the change of control event or if such entity is a then-current Affiliate of the party), the license rights granted under Article II shall be limited to the operation of the business and the products, systems, and services existing as of the effective date of the change of control event. In this scenario, no additional rights or licenses granted under Article II may be extended to the Acquiring Entity or its Affiliates in connection with any of their past, current, or future products, systems, or services.",
