The total amount payable under this agreement will be $1,275,000.\n\nExplanation: The original clause specifies that Reseller must make four quarterly payments to Diversinet by specific dates in 2011 and 2012 for a total of $700,000. The rewritten clause states that there will be seven installments payable, three more than originally stated, with the first payment due on December 1, 2011, and subsequent payments every three months thereafter over a period of two additional years (2013). This modification weakens the obligation on Reseller by increasing the total amount they need to pay while extending the timeframe. However, it is important to note that this rewritten clause must be consistent with other terms and conditions in the agreement.",
