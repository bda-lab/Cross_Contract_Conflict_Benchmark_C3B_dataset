In the event that Party A fails to perform its obligations under this Agreement within a reasonable timeframe, Party B shall, at its discretion, provide Party A with written notice specifying the nature of such failure and afford Party A a period of no less than 30 days to remedy the situation.\n\n2. If Party A does not remedy the said situation within the stipulated timeframe, Party B shall have the right, but not the obligation, to terminate this Agreement upon providing written notice to Party A.\"\n\nBy slightly altering the clause, we have weakened the obligation on Party B and inverted the condition under which termination can occur. It's important to note that the changes made maintain a professional and realistic tone while ensuring clarity for both parties involved.",
