Such Card list shall be provided to AEIS by Schoolpop via disk/CD and sent via a form of shipment where signature is required upon delivery.

    "ollama_generated": "9. ENCOMPASS(R) SELECT TERMS\n\n a. From the Effective Date through September 30, 2004, AEIS grants Schoolpop the right to order non-standard Encompass(R) Select denominations (other than 25, 50, 75, and 100 Points), exceeding the minimum quantity of 100 Cards per order. These non-standard denominations will be fulfilled within eight (8) weeks. Schoolpop may order these denominations in boxes that are not necessarily of like denominations, subject to a maximum total of 200 Points. The total value of Encompass(R) Select sales by Schoolpop through December 31, 2004 is capped at $26,500,000. This cap may be adjusted upwards if Persona Select actual sales exceed their forecasted sales for the period ending December 31, 2004. The adjustment will be based on a three-to-one ratio of Encompass Select sales to Persona Select Sales. Schoolpop is required to cease reselling Encompass(R) Select Cards as of December 31, 2004 and to manage and forecast its Encompass(R) Select Card requirements effectively to deplete its inventory by this date.\n\nIn the event that Schoolpop has unsold Encompass Select Cards in its inventory as of December 31, 2004, it shall provide AEIS with the following information no later than January 5, 2005: the Encompass(R) Select Card numbers, the respective expiration dates and denominations of the Cards.

AEIS will then issue an invoice to Schoolpop for the applicable destruction fees of $2.00 per Card, which shall be payable by Schoolpop within thirty (30) days upon receipt of the invoice.\n\nIn essence, this clause grants Schoolpop the flexibility to order non-standard Encompass(R) Select denominations in quantities greater than 100 Cards per order and allows for the possibility of increased sales caps if Persona Select sales exceed their forecasts. Additionally, it requires Schoolpop to manage its inventory effectively and to provide AEIS with details of any unsold Encompass Select Cards by a specified date. Lastly, it outlines that AEIS will invoice Schoolpop for destruction fees should there be any unsold Encompass Select Cards in Schoolpop's inventory after December 31, 2004.",
