    "modified": "Clause (Adjusted Obligation):\nExhibit B Source: REVISED PIPELINE SYSTEMS PARTNERS, LLC, S-1/B, 7/31/2020\n\nUpon occurrence of any Force Majeure Event, the Parties shall make reasonable efforts to resume their respective obligations under this Agreement, subject to the following exceptions: (i) The Affected Party may suspend its performance without liability for any delay or failure in fulfilling its obligations hereunder if such delay or failure is caused by an event beyond its control and not reasonably foreseeable at the time of entering into this Agreement; however, the Affected Party shall use best efforts to promptly notify the other Party of the occurrence of such Force Majeure Event and shall resume performance as soon as reasonably practicable upon its cessation. (ii) In no event shall either Party be required to perform any obligation if compliance with such obligation would violate any applicable law, rule or regulation, provided that the Party fails to use reasonable best efforts to secure any necessary exemptions, waivers or authorizations from competent authorities in order to permit compliance with its obligations under this Agreement. (iii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Party acknowledges that the other Party's failure to perform its obligations due to a Force Majeure Event shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or give rise to any right to terminate this Agreement by either Party.\n\nIn essence, this clause adjusts the original one by weakening the obligation of the parties to maintain their obligations under the agreement during a Force Majeure Event. It now allows for temporary suspensions in performance and even non-compliance with some obligations if such actions would violate any law or regulation. Additionally, it removes the potential for termination due to a Force Majeure Event-related breach. The clause also adds specific conditions and exceptions that need to be met for the temporary suspension or non-compliance.",
