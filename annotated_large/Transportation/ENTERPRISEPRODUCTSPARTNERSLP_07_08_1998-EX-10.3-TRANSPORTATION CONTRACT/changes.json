In instances where a trailer is utilized by the Shipper without being exclusively assigned for a period of more than 90 days, and if the trailer is not engaged in revenue-generating service for any day or portion thereof, the following charges per vehicle, per day, shall be applicable:\n\nThis revised clause now applies to situations where the trailer is used by the Shipper but not exclusively assigned for a period greater than 90 days. The original clause applied when the trailer was exclusively assigned for at least 90 days and not in revenue-producing service. Additionally, this new clause suggests that the trailer may be shared among multiple shippers during this extended period, whereas the original clause implied it was only for the exclusive use of one shipper.",
