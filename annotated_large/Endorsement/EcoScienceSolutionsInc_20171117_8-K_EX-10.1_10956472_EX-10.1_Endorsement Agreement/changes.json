In the rewritten clause, the verb tense is changed from the past perfect continuous (\"have caused\") to the simple past (\"initiated and finalized\"), which implies a less active role in creating the agreement but still maintains that they were involved in its completion. The wording \"between the parties herein\" is maintained, as it refers to the contractual relationship between the parties named in the document. Lastly, \"as of the date first stated above\" is used instead of \"above written,\" emphasizing that the agreement's effectiveness began on the date mentioned earlier in the document rather than when the document itself was written.",
