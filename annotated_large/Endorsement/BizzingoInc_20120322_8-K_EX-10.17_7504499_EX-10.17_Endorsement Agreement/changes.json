For a Proposed Profile to be considered Active, the potential user must be informed about its existence on the Network. The user will then need to: (i) initiate a search within the Bizzingo database for their Proposed Profile and (ii) verify or customize the Proposed Profile by adding content. Once these actions have been carried out by the user, they will be recognized as an \"Active User\" and the Network shall identify them accordingly.
