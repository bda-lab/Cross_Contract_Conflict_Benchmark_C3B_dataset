    "original": "(a) Grantee shall pay to Grantor a Franchise Fee which shall be calculated pursuant to this Section. It is understood that Grantee has or will enter into franchise agreements with the City of Roanoke (\u201cRoanoke\u201d) and the City of Salem (\u201cSalem\u201d) and the Town of Vinton (\u201cVinton\u201d) (Grantor, Roanoke and Salem being hereinafter sometimes collectively referred to as the \u201clocalities\u201d and singularly as a \u201clocality\u201d) with fee provisions identical to this one, and that the total annual Franchise Fee to be paid to the three localities in aggregate is $98,196 for calendar year 2016 (\u201cbase year total annual Franchise Fee\u201d). Grantor\u2019s Franchise Fee shall be a percentage share of the base year total annual Franchise Fee, which shall be determined on a pro rata basis according to its percentage share of the total dollar value of Grantee\u2019s gas sales occurring within the localities during the calendar year. For each calendar year of the Franchise, each locality\u2019s percentage share shall be determined by the following formula:",
    "modified": "(a) The Localities (defined as Grantor, City of Roanoke, City of Salem, and Town of Vinton, singularly referred to as a \"Locality\") hereby agree that Grantee is required to pay a Franchise Fee, the calculation method for which is detailed within this Section. It is acknowledged by both parties that the Grantee has or will establish franchise agreements with the Localities, and that these agreements shall contain fee provisions equivalent to those outlined in the present document. The total annual Franchise Fee payable to each Locality individually for calendar year 2016 (\"base year total annual Franchise Fee\") is $98,196.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the Grantee's obligation towards the Franchise Fee shall not exceed its pro rata share of the base year total annual Franchise Fee. This pro rata share will be determined by calculating the percentage ratio between the dollar value of Grantee's gas sales within the Localities during the calendar year and the total dollar value of all gas sales made by the Localities combined during the same period. For each subsequent year of the Franchise, the pro rata share for each Locality will be calculated using the following formula:\n\n[The formula here remains the same as in the original clause.]",
