H. This Guarantee shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of the state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated. In the event of any conflict of law, the laws of such state shall prevail, without regard to the application of such state’s conflict of law rules. If, however, any provision of this Guarantee would not be enforceable under the laws of the state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated, and if the Master Franchisee’s franchised business is located outside of such state and such provision would be enforceable under the laws of the state in which the Master Franchisee’s franchised business is located, then such provision shall be interpreted and construed under the laws of that state. Any action brought to enforce or interpret this Guarantee in any court, whether federal or state, shall be brought within the county and state in which Franchisor has its principal place of business at the time the action is initiated, and Guarantors hereby waive all questions of personal jurisdiction or venue for the purpose of carrying out this provision.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  each of the undersigned has signed this Guarantee as of the day and year set forth below.

GUARANTORS  :

Date:   Date:

Whereas Party A has agreed to perform certain services for Party B, the terms of which are set forth herein, and for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged by both parties, the following provisions shall govern the relationship between the parties:

Instead of Party A's obligation to complete the aforementioned services in a timely manner, the parties agree that Party A shall make reasonable efforts to complete such services within a commercially reasonable timeframe. If, for reasons beyond Party A's control, the completion of said services is delayed, Party B acknowledges and agrees that Party A will not be held responsible for liquidated damages or any penalties in excess of the actual, direct costs incurred by Party A as a result of the delay.

Previously, Party B had the right to terminate this agreement if Party A breached any material provision herein. Now, Party B shall have the option to terminate this agreement for any reason whatsoever, upon providing written notice to Party A. However, if Party B elects to terminate this agreement, and if Party A has already incurred costs related to the performance of the services, Party B shall be responsible for reimbursing Party A for those costs.

Finally, any disputes arising from this agreement shall be resolved through mediation before resorting to arbitration or litigation. Prior to initiating such dispute resolution process, each party must first provide written notice to the other party, detailing the specific issue in dispute and the remedies sought. In the event that the parties are unable to resolve their differences through mediation, they may seek binding arbitration or litigate in accordance with applicable law.

In the event that any provision of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such finding shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof, which shall remain in full force and effect. This agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties, superseding all prior agreements, representations, or understandings, whether oral or written.
