If, for reasons beyond Party A's control, the completion of said services is delayed, Party B acknowledges and agrees that Party A will not be held responsible for liquidated damages or any penalties in excess of the actual, direct costs incurred by Party A as a result of the delay.\n\nPreviously, Party B had the right to terminate this agreement if Party A breached any material provision herein. Now, Party B shall have the option to terminate this agreement for any reason whatsoever, upon providing written notice to Party A. However, if Party B elects to terminate this agreement, and if Party A has already incurred costs related to the performance of the services, Party B shall be responsible for reimbursing Party A for those costs.\n\nFinally, any disputes arising from this agreement shall be resolved through mediation before resorting to arbitration or litigation. Prior to initiating such dispute resolution process, each party must first provide written notice to the other party, detailing the specific issue in dispute and the remedies sought. In the event that the parties are unable to resolve their differences through mediation, they may seek binding arbitration or litigate in accordance with applicable law.\n\nIn the event that any provision of this agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, such finding shall not affect the remaining provisions hereof, which shall remain in full force and effect. This agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the parties, superseding all prior agreements, representations, or understandings, whether oral or written.\n\nSigned:\nParty A ___________________________     Party B ___________________________",
