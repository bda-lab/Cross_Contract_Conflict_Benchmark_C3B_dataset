In the revised clause, the obligation has been weakened slightly to imply that the parties have been made aware of the terms but are now agreeing to be bound by them only after having had an opportunity to seek independent legal advice. This change does not necessarily mean that the parties have actually sought such advice, but it gives them a potential out if they later find that they did not fully understand the agreement's implications.",

(Original Clause)\n\nIn the event that this Agreement is not fully executed or performed by either party, the non-defaulting party shall have no obligation to mitigate damages or losses arising from such breach, and may terminate this Agreement immediately, but shall not be held liable for any losses incurred by the defaulting party. (Rewritten Clause)\n\nIn this revised clause, the original obligation of the non-performing party to \"mitigate damages\" has been removed, meaning that they are no longer required to take steps to minimize damages resulting from their breach. Additionally, the language has been altered slightly to shift responsibility for losses away from the non-defaulting party and towards the defaulting party.",
