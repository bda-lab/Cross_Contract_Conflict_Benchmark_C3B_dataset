Limited Franchise Permission: Grantor permits Franchisee, under certain terms and conditions set forth herein and for valuable consideration acknowledged by both parties, to utilize the Grilled Cheese Truck trademarks and systems within [Specified Territory], limited to a single franchise operation. Franchisee shall have no claim or ownership of any other Grilled Cheese Trucks.\n\nThe original clause grants the Franchisee a right to operate one Grilled Cheese Truck franchise, which is non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable. The rewritten clause shifts the focus towards permission from the Grantor to utilize the trademarks and systems of the Grilled Cheese Truck within a specific territory for a single franchise operation, with no ownership or rights over any other Grilled Cheese Trucks. This change slightly weakens the Franchisee's position by emphasizing the limited nature of their agreement and shifting some control to the Grantor.",
