The intent is to interpret each provision in the most legal and enforceable manner possible under relevant Laws. If a court or tribunal deems any provision of this Agreement unlawful or unenforceable, it will be considered void, but all other provisions shall continue to apply without interruption. Any voided provision will be replaced with one of similar intention that is permissible according to applicable Confidential Execution Version 11.17 Counterparts Execution . This Agreement may be signed in multiple parts, each considered a valid original. An electronic (e.g., pdf) copy bearing a signature can serve as evidence of a party's signature and be equally binding as if a physical signed copy had been exchanged.\n\nIn this version, the obligation of each provision to remain enforceable is weakened by making it conditional on being valid under applicable laws. Also, instead of severing an unenforceable provision and having the rest of the agreement continue in full force, any voided provisions will be replaced with one of similar intention that is permissible according to applicable Confidential Execution Version. Lastly, the language has been adjusted to make it clearer that electronic signatures are valid and binding as if a physical signed copy had been exchanged.",
