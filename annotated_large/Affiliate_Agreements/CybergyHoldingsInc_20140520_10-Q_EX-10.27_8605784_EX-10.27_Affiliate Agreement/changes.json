(Originally: In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be found invalid or unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such provision shall be severed from this Agreement and the remaining provisions shall be enforced.)\n\nIn this revised version, instead of the provision being severed if deemed invalid or unenforceable, it is now modified to the minimum extent necessary to make it valid and enforceable. This change makes the obligation slightly weaker by preserving the remainder of the agreement in case any part becomes invalid or unenforceable.",
