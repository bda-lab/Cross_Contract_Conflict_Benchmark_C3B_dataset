Upon termination of this Agreement, for any reason, each Party hereto shall return to the other Party, or destroy,  all of such Party's  Confidential  Information  in the  possession of the other Party.  This provision shall apply to Confidential  Information  that is in the possession of  subcontractors or agents of each Party. Each Party shall retain no copies of the Confidential  Information of the other Party except as may be required by law.",
    "ollama_generated": "c. Implications of Termination. Upon termination of this Agreement, regardless of the cause, it is incumbent upon each Party to either safeguard or irreversibly eliminate all Confidential Information that they possess within the other Party's domain. This obligation extends to any Confidential Information held by subcontractors or representatives acting on behalf of either Party. Under no circumstances shall either Party retain unauthorized copies of the Confidential Information belonging to the other Party, except when mandated by law.\n\nIn this revised clause, the emphasis has shifted from an obligation for immediate return or destruction of Confidential Information upon termination to a more passive \"safeguard or irreversibly eliminate\". This weakening allows some flexibility in how the parties handle the information post-termination while still ensuring that the confidential data is protected. The clause now also includes the phrase \"under no circumstances\" which strengthens the prohibition against retaining unauthorized copies, but only when specifically mandated by law.",
