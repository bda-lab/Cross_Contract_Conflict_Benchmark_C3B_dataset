For clarity within this Exhibit D, the count of Digital Cable Subscriber Households will be determined by the certified reports supplied by each Multichannel Video Programming Distributor (MVPD) offering the service, as described in Section 7(a) of the main agreement. In instances where such a report is not received by Network from every MVPD carrying the Service, for purposes of this Exhibit D, the number of Digital Cable Subscriber Households will be estimated as follows:\n\nIn this revised clause, the emphasis has shifted to the Affiliate receiving the Affiliate Revenue Share, and the calculation method remains largely unchanged.
