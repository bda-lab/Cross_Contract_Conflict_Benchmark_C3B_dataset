Specifically, the exercise by Seller of its rights under the CREDIT CLAUSE, based on Buyer's delay in payment or perceived financial instability for any reason, shall not be deemed to be a waiver of Seller's right to take similar actions in response to future breaches or defaults.\n\nIn such cases where Seller invokes the CREDIT CLAUSE, it reserves, without limiting its other contractual or legal rights, the following remedies:\n- The immediate suspension of further deliveries of product pending resolution of the issue;\n- The modification or amendment of existing payment terms;\n- The acceleration of Buyer's payment obligations, rendering all previously unpaid amounts immediately due and payable;\n- The requirement for Buyer to provide security deemed appropriate by Seller, as a condition for future deliveries;\n- The exercise of rights against any collateral provided by Buyer or applied to the account;\n- The application of any proceeds from such collateral towards outstanding amounts owed by Buyer.\n\nAdditionally, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller retains the right to set off any claim it (or its affiliate) may have against Buyer (or its affiliate), against any sum which Buyer (or its affiliate) owes to Seller (or its affiliate). This right of set-off shall apply whether or not such claims are in liquidated damages or otherwise.",
