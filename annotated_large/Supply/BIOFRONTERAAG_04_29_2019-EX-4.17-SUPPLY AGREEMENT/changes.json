This payment shall be made via wire transfer into an account designated by Ferrer. Notification of the invoice amount will be issued by the Supplier upon shipment of the Products, and this invoice should be emailed to the following address: invoice@cutanea.com for prompt processing.\n\nIn this revised version, I've slightly altered the original clause to invert the condition by giving the Company more time to make the payment after receiving and accepting the products. Additionally, I've emphasized the Supplier's obligation to issue an invoice upon shipment rather than at receipt and acceptance.",
