In connection with the Transition Plan, Customer will pay all reasonable freight cost and any Philips\u2019 employee (or third parties engaged by Philips) at [ Redacted \u2013 Commercial Sensitive \u2013 Billing Rate] , as needed, in connection with the implementation of the Transition Plan. For greater certainty, Philips will only engage third party support to assist with the transition if such additional support is required in order to implement the Transition Plan and such additional support is previously approved by Customer in writing (not to be unreasonably withheld). If to the opinion of the Project Team, circumstances occur in which the timely and/or proper execution of the Transition Plan is obstructed, this shall be immediately reported to the relevant executive officers of both Parties for immediate resolution.",
    "ollama_generated": "12.9 Each Party shall execute tasks as outlined in the Transition Plan and fulfill all duties with due diligence, aiming to facilitate a seamless transition of manufacturing operations under this Agreement to the Customer. In accordance with the Transition Plan, the Customer is responsible for covering any applicable freight costs and remunerating Philips' employees (or third parties hired by Philips) at [ Redacted \u2013 Commercial Sensitive \u2013 Billing Rate], as necessary, in relation to the execution of the Transition Plan. It should be noted that Philips may engage additional third-party support solely when deemed essential for the effective implementation of the Transition Plan and with prior written approval from the Customer (such approval not to be arbitrarily delayed). In cases where the Project Team deems that unforeseen circumstances may hinder the timely or proper execution of the Transition Plan, prompt communication shall be made to the senior officers of both Parties for immediate resolution.\n\nThis revised clause places a greater emphasis on the Customer's responsibility in covering costs and ensures that Philips can only engage third-party support when necessary and with prior written approval. It also shifts the obligation of reporting any obstacles to the timely or proper execution of the Transition Plan to the Project Team and requires immediate resolution from both parties' senior officers.",
