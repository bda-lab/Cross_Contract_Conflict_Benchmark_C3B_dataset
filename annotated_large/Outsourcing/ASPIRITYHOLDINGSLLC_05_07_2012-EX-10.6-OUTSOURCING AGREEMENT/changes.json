The mutual indemnification and contribution commitments made by both the Company and the Contractor within this Agreement, as well as their respective representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements, shall continue to bind each party post-effectuation of any investigation conducted by or on behalf of the Contractor, the Company, its officers, directors, or any controlling entity mentioned in Article VII. This survival clause persists beyond the sale of the Notes and any dissolution or termination of this Agreement. Any entity succeeding the initial parties or controlling persons, or their legal representatives, shall inherit these mutual indemnification and contribution commitments.\n\nThis revision subtly shifts the responsibility to both parties for the survival of obligations after an investigation, sale of Notes, or termination/cancellation of the Agreement, while keeping the language professional and easily understandable.",
