E.PIPHANY, INC.\n\nTo clarify our respective obligations and responsibilities, we hereby agree as follows:\n\nIn the event that High Speed Net Solutions, Inc., suffers any loss or damage arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, it shall be solely responsible for proving that such loss or damage was not caused by its own acts or omissions, except where E.Piphany, Inc.'s negligence has directly contributed to the said loss or damage. (Original: E.Piphanry, Inc. shall indemnify and hold High Speed Net Solutions, Inc. harmless from any claims, losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses arising out of or in connection with this Agreement as a result of its negligence.)\n\nPreviously, the original clause had E.Piphanry, Inc. indemnifying High Speed Net Solutions, Inc. for any loss or damage resulting from its own negligence. The revised clause shifts the burden of proof to High Speed Net Solutions, Inc., and makes it responsible for demonstrating that its actions did not cause the loss or damage, except in cases where E.Piphany's negligence contributed directly to the said loss or damage. This change weakens the obligation on E.Piphanry, Inc. by reducing their level of responsibility for any potential losses or damages.",
