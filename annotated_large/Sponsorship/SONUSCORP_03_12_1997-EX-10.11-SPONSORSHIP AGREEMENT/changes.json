The parties agree that the invalid or unenforceable provision shall be reformed so as to reflect as nearly as possible their original intention. If it is not feasible to reformation, such provision shall be severed without affecting the validity or enforceability of any other provision.\n\n(c) This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding and agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Each party acknowledges that, in entering into this Agreement, it does not rely on, and has no remedy for, any statement, representation, warranty, or promise made by any other person, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement.\n\nIn this revised clause, the original obligation to not amend or modify the agreement except in writing signed by both parties remains, but now it includes a provision that any waiver of a breach or default does not imply a waiver of future breaches or defaults. This allows for some flexibility without completely eliminating the obligation. Additionally, if a court finds any part of this Agreement invalid or unenforceable, rather than voiding the entire agreement, it will be amended to reflect the original intention as closely as possible, or if that's not feasible, it will be severed without affecting the rest of the agreement. Lastly, the clause emphasizes that the agreement is the complete understanding between the parties and no other promises or representations are binding unless explicitly stated in this Agreement.",
