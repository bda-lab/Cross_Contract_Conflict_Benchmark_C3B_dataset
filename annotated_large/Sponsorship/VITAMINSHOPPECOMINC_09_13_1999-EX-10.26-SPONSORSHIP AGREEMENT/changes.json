Therefore, any breach or failure to perform by either party shall not be deemed as a material breach unless such breach or failure constitutes a fundamental violation of the provisions of this Agreement. The Client acknowledges that it has the right to terminate this Agreement at any time upon providing written notice to Excite. However, in such event, the Client shall remain liable for all fees and obligations accrued up to the date of termination.\n\nThis Agreement may be amended or modified only by a written instrument executed by both parties. In the event of any conflict or ambiguity between any provision of this Agreement and any subsequent communications between the parties, including any correspondence, this Agreement shall prevail.\n\nGoverning Law: This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California without giving effect to its conflict of laws provisions. Any legal action arising out of or related to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively in the federal or state courts located in San Mateo County, California, and the parties consent to the jurisdiction of such courts.\n\nEntire Agreement: This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral or written communications between the parties. The waiver by either party of any default, breach, or condition of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of similar defaults, breaches, or conditions thereafter occurring.\n\nSeverability: If any provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of the Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. In such case, the parties agree that the court will reform the invalid or unenforceable provision to the maximum extent permissible under applicable law so as to affect the intent of the parties, and, if cannot be reformed, replace it with a valid provision that accomplishes the intended purpose of the original provision.\n\nForce Majeure: Neither party shall be liable for any failure or delay in performance under this Agreement due to causes beyond its reasonable control, including acts of God, strikes, wars, riots, embargoes, terrorism, governmental action, or communications failures.",
