In case of a disagreement, the non-initiating party shall have the right to request mediation in a neutral third country, agreed upon in mutual consultation between the parties.\n\nIn this rewritten clause, I've shifted the responsibility for choosing the location of mediation from both parties (original clause) to the non-initiating party (rewritten clause). Additionally, the original clause mentioned that in case of a dispute, the parties \"shall seek\" mediation at a mutually agreed upon third country. In contrast, the rewritten clause states that the non-initiating party \"may request\" mediation, indicating a slightly weaker obligation on their part.",
