The Merchant agrees to facilitate and ensure compatibility with the terminals (\"Merchant Terminals\"), at their respective locations, for connection to the shared electronic funds transfer networks as outlined on Schedule A to this Exhibit G, which may be amended unilaterally by FDMS in its discretion (the \"Debit Networks\"). The Merchant Terminals will transmit point of sale transactions (\"POS Transactions\") generated by these terminals through the Debit Networks' telecommunications and processing systems, which include switching, processing, and settlement capabilities collectively known as the \"Debit Network Systems.\" (The duties described in this section shall be referred to in this Exhibit G as the \"Network Compatibility Obligations.\")\n\nIn case of any discrepancies or interpretations, this revised clause signifies that the responsibility for maintaining and deploying the POS Terminals is shifted from ISO to the Merchant. The Merchant is now responsible for ensuring their terminals are compatible with the networks specified in the agreement, and the clause has been renamed \"Network Compatibility Obligations\" to reflect this change.",
