These statements are based on the assumptions and judgments of HC2's management team and that of its subsidiaries and portfolio companies. Whilst we believe these assumptions to be reasonable, it is essential to understand that these statements do not guarantee results or performance, as our actual outcomes may differ substantially from those suggested in the predictive statements due to various important factors, both favorable and unfavorable, which may alter or supplement over time, as detailed in subsequent filings with the SEC, including our Forms 10-K, 10-Q, and 8-K. Such significant factors include, but are not limited to, issues associated with the restatement of our financial statements; the existence of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, and any failure to rectify future material weaknesses; market conditions, including HC2's and its subsidiaries' ability to procure capital; the ability of HC2\u2019s subsidiaries and portfolio companies to generate net income and cash flow for upstream distributions; volatility in the trading price of HC2's common stock; our capacity to identify suitable future acquisition or disposal opportunities; the realization of efficiencies, cost savings, income and margin improvements, growth, economies of scale, and other anticipated benefits from strategic transactions; difficulties integrating the financial reporting of acquired or targeted businesses; complications completing pending and future acquisitions and divestitures; actions by activist shareholders, such as proxy contests, consent solicitations, or unsolicited takeover proposals; effects of litigation, indemnification claims, and other contingent liabilities; changes in regulations and tax laws; the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic; and risks that may influence the performance of HC2's operating subsidiaries and portfolio companies. While we are optimistic about our future operational performance, there can be no assurance that the forecasted outcomes will materialize. The aforementioned risks, among others detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC, and our other reports submitted to the SEC could lead to results materially different from those suggested by the predictive statements made in this communication.",
