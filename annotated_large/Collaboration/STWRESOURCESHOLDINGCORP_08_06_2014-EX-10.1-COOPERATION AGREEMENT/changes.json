In the absence of such a response within this timeframe, it shall be deemed that the Responding Party does not contest the claim. However, the failure of the Responding Party to respond shall not constitute an admission or waiver of any liability or responsibility on its part, nor shall it bar the Responding Party from raising any defenses or counterclaims in subsequent proceedings. The Initial Claimant's right to seek resolution through binding arbitration, as outlined in this agreement, remains unaffected by this provision.\n\nIn essence, we have altered the original clause to make it clearer that a lack of response from the Responding Party does not necessarily mean acceptance or admission of liability, and that they can still raise defenses or counterclaims later on. Additionally, we have made it explicit that the Initial Claimant retains their right to seek resolution through binding arbitration.",
