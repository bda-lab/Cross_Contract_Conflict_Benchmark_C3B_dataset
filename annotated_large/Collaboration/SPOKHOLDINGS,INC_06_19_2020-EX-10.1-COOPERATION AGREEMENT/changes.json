This Agreement may be terminated at any time by either Party with written notice, effective immediately. However, any breaches of this Agreement prior to the termination shall survive and remain enforceable by the aggrieved Party.\n\nIn this version, I've made the clause more flexible by allowing for termination at any time with written notice, as opposed to having a specific Support Period in Section 4. Additionally, I've shifted the responsibility of enforcing prior breaches to the party that was aggrieved (i.e., the one who suffered harm from the breach), rather than stating that no Party is released from any pre-termination breaches.",
