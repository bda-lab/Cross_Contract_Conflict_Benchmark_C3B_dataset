The objective here is not only to meet the Agreement's goals but also to strive for continuous improvement.\n\nEach party will deploy suitable personnel and resources, and sustain necessary laboratories and facilities as deemed reasonable by industry norms and this Agreement, to fulfill the responsibilities outlined in this Agreement, including any Project Plans. Conformant with standard practices within the industry and the provisions of this Agreement, each party is responsible for creating and maintaining accurate, comprehensive written records, accounts, notes, reports, and data pertaining to their actions under this Agreement, including any Project Plans.\n\nIn a collaborative effort, the parties will establish and agree upon minimum performance thresholds concerning the marketing, sales, and operational performance of the Tests, encompassing the Demand Forecast, as well as the punctuality, accuracy, dependability, and reporting of the Tests, customer service responsiveness regarding the Tests across the Territory (collectively, \"Quality Thresholds\"). Should a party fail to meet one or more Quality Thresholds, both parties will collaborate promptly and effectively to:\n\n- Identify the root cause of the underperformance.\n- Develop a corrective action plan to address the issue.\n- Implement the proposed solution in a timely manner.\n\nIf, despite our best efforts, we cannot resolve an identified quality concern using this process, such persistent failure to meet the Quality Thresholds will constitute a significant breach by the non-compliant party, providing the other party with grounds for termination of this Agreement, in accordance with Section 11.2, should they deem it necessary.",
