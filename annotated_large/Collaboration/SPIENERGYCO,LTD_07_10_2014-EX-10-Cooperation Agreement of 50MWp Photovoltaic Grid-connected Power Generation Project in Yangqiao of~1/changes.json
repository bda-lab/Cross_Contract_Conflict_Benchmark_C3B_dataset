While Party B maintains the discretion to decide on its level of involvement, it is open to pursuing the establishment of a 50MWp photovoltaic grid-connected power generation project in Fenyi County. In spirit of fairness, potential benefits, and collaborative success, both parties may opt to reach an agreement regarding project-related matters, should they mutually deem it advantageous:\n\nThis revised clause shifts the initiative from Party A to Party B for investment decisions while keeping the cooperation agreement optional. Additionally, it emphasizes mutual discretion in choosing whether or not to enter into an agreement, which weakens the obligation compared to the original clause.",
