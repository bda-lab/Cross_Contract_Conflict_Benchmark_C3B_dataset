Judgment may be entered upon such an award in any court having jurisdiction.\n\nIn this revised clause, the focus has shifted from arbitration being the first course of action for resolving disputes to it being a last resort after good faith negotiations have failed. Additionally, the initial obligation is now on the Parties to negotiate in good faith before arbitration is invoked, and the language has been modified to clarify that either Party may elect arbitration if negotiations fail. The Party seeking provisional relief is no longer obligated to continue participating in the arbitration process following such action; instead, they must continue in good faith with the initial attempts at resolution through negotiation.",
