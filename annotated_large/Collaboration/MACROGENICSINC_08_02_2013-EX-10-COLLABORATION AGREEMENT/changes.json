Such disclosures shall be made only if necessary and with the prior written consent of the Disclosing Party. Portions of this exhibit have been omitted pursuant to a request for confidential treatment. An unredacted version of this exhibit has been filed separately with the Commission.\n\nIn this revised clause, the original clause required the disclosure of information only when it was reasonably necessary to obtain Patents or authorizations. In the new version, I have weakened the obligation slightly by allowing the Disclosing Party the discretion to make additional disclosures beyond what is reasonably required, but only with its prior written consent. Additionally, I have inverted the condition in (ii) so that the Receiving Party may require disclosure instead of it being solely at the Disclosing Party's discretion.
