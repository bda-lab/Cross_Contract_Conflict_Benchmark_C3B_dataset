As between the parties hereto the Indemnitor shall have the right to control the defense and settlement of such claim, action, suit, or other proceeding\u037e provided, that the Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in such defense or settlement with counsel of its own choosing at its expense. The Indemnitee shall not make any settlement of any loss, claim, damage, liability or action without the consent of the Indemnitor, to the extent such consent is not withheld unreasonably or delayed. The failure to deliver written notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after the commencement of any such action, if prejudicial to its ability to defend such action, shall relieve such Indemnitor of any liability to the Indemnitee under this Article 17 but the omission so to deliver written notice to the Indemnitor shall not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability that it may have to any Indemnitee otherwise than under this Article 17.

Any party (hereafter referred to as the \"Claimant\") seeking indemnity under any provision of this Agreement is obligated to provide written notice to the other party (the \"Indemnitor\") within a reasonable time upon becoming aware of any claim, action, suit, or other proceeding brought by third parties in respect of which the Claimant or any of its Affiliates, or their directors, officers, employees, successors, or assigns may be entitled to indemnification. The Indemnitor shall have the sole discretion to decide on the defense and settlement strategy for such claim, action, suit, or other proceeding; however, the Claimant shall be permitted to participate in the defense or settlement process, at its own expense, with counsel of its choice. Any settlement made by the Claimant regarding any loss, claim, damage, liability, or action requires the prior written consent of the Indemnitor, unless such consent is unreasonably withheld or delayed. If the Claimant fails to provide written notice to the Indemnitor within a reasonable time after the commencement of any such action and this failure prejudices the Indemnitor's ability to defend the action, then the Indemnitor shall not be liable to the Claimant under this Article 17. However, the Claimant's failure to provide notice shall not absolve the Indemnitor of any liability it may have to the Claimant outside of this Article 17. The Claimant is responsible for keeping the Indemnitor fully apprised of the progress of any claim, action, suit, or other proceeding for which indemnification is sought under this Article 17.",
