If Party B elects to terminate this Agreement, it will notify Party A in writing and this Agreement will terminate upon receipt of such written notice by Party A.

In the event Party A elects to terminate, they will provide written notice to Party B, and such termination shall become effective immediately upon receipt of said notice by Party B.\n\nUpon termination, all outstanding cooperation fees related to the Cooperation Channel that accrue after the fourth anniversary of the date hereof shall be the responsibility of Party A. Furthermore, Party A will assume control of all matters pertaining to the operation and construction of the Cooperation Channel following termination. It is worth noting that such termination shall not affect any rights or obligations that have already been fulfilled prior to the effective date of termination.\n\nIn this revised version, the obligation to conduct a review before terminating has shifted from Party B to Party A, and the responsibility for outstanding cooperation fees following the fourth anniversary is now on Party A in case of termination. Additionally, the wording has been adjusted to maintain clarity and professionalism throughout the clause.",
