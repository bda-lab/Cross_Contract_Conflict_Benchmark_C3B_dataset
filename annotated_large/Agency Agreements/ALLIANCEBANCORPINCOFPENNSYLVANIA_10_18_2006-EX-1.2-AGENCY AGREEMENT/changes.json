In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in Section 6 hereof is for any reason held to be unenforceable by the indemnified parties although applicable in accordance with its terms, the Company, the MHCs, the Bank, and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Company, the MHCs or the Bank and the Agent, as incurred, in such proportions (i) that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the maximum aggregate marketing fees appearing on the cover page of the Prospectus bears to the maximum aggregate gross proceeds appearing thereon and the Company, the MHCs and the Bank are jointly and severally responsible for the balance or (ii) if, but only if, the allocation provided for in clause (i) is for any reason held unenforceable, in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits to the Company, the MHCs and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the other, as reflected in clause (i), but also the relative fault of the Company, the MHCs and the Bank on the one hand and the Agent on the other, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations\u037e  provided, however , that no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

In situations where the indemnification stipulated in Section 6 becomes unenforceable for any reason, despite complying with its terms, each party involved, including the Company, MHCs, Bank, and Agent, will proportionately contribute to the overall losses, liabilities, claims, damages, and expenses stemming from the indemnity agreement. This contribution will be determined as follows:\n\n(i) The Agent's responsibility shall correspond to the percentage that their maximum aggregate marketing fees on the Prospectus cover page represents relative to the maximum aggregate gross proceeds shown thereon. The remaining responsibility, including that of the Company, MHCs, and Bank, will be shared jointly and severally.\n\n(ii) If for any reason the initial allocation in (i) is deemed unenforceable, an equitable contribution ratio will be established by considering the relative benefits to each party, as well as their respective fault and other relevant equitable factors. However, it should be noted that no person found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (in accordance with Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be eligible for contributions from individuals not involved in such misrepresentation.\n\nFor clarity, any party controlling the Agent, as defined by Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, will enjoy the same contribution rights as the Agent. Similarly, directors of the Company, MHCs, and Bank, officers of the Company who signed the Registration Statement, and parties controlling the Company, MHCs, or Bank, as defined by Sections 15 or 20, will have the same contribution rights as the respective entities they represent.\n\nFinally, it is important to note that in accordance with applicable law, the Agent's total contributions shall not exceed the aggregate marketing fees earned and paid under this Agreement.",
