    "original": "Section 10. Contribution . In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in circumstances in which the indemnification provided for in Section 9 is due in accordance with its terms but is for any reason held by a court to be unavailable from the Blue Hills Parties or the Agent, the Blue Hills Parties and the Agent shall contribute to the aggregate losses, claims, damages and liabilities (including any investigation, legal and other expenses incurred in connection with, and any amount paid in settlement of, any action, suit or proceeding, but after deducting any contribution received by the Blue Hills Parties or the Agent from persons other than the other parties thereto, who may also be liable for contribution) in such proportion so that the Agent is responsible for that portion represented by the percentage that the fees paid to the Agent pursuant to Section 2 of this Agreement (not including expenses) bears to the gross proceeds received by the Holding Company from the sale of the Shares in the Offering, and the Blue Hills Parties shall be responsible for the balance. If, however, the allocation provided above is not permitted by applicable law, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not only such relative fault of the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand and the Agent on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereto), but also the relative benefits received by the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand and the Agent on the other from the Offering (before deducting expenses). The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Blue Hills Parties on the one hand or the Agent on the other and the parties\u2019 relative intent, good faith, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Blue Hills Parties and the Agent agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 10 were determined by pro-rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take into account the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section 10. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions, proceedings or claims in respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 10 shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action, proceeding or claim. It is expressly agreed that the Agent shall not be liable for any loss, liability, claim, damage or expense or be required to contribute any amount pursuant to Section 9(b) or this Section 10 which in the aggregate exceeds the amount paid (excluding reimbursable expenses) to the Agent under this Agreement. It is understood that the above stated limitation on the Agent\u2019s liability is essential to the Agent and that the Agent would not have entered into this Agreement if such limitation had not been agreed to by the parties to this Agreement. No person found guilty of any fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not found guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Blue Hills Parties under this Section 10 and under Section 9 shall be in addition to any liability which the Holding Company and the Agent may otherwise have. For purposes of this Section 10, each of the Agent\u2019s and the Blue Hills Parties\u2019 officers and directors and each person, if any, who controls the Agent or any of the Blue Hills Parties within the meaning of the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act shall have the same rights to contribution as the Agent on the one hand, or, the Blue Hills Parties on the other hand. Any party entitled to contribution, promptly after receipt of notice of commencement of any action, suit, claim or proceeding against such party in respect of which a claim for contribution may be made against another party under this Section 10, will notify such party from whom contribution may be sought, but the omission to so notify such party shall not relieve the party from whom contribution may be sought from any other obligation it may have hereunder or otherwise than under this Section 10 unless and to the extent the party has been materially prejudiced through the forfeiture by the other party of substantial rights and defenses.",
    "ollama_generated": "Section 10. Allocation of Responsibility in the Event of Indemnification Limitations. In instances where the indemnification outlined in Section 9 becomes unavailable from either the Blue Hills Parties or the Agent due to judicial determination, the Agent and the Blue Hills Parties will proportionately share any resulting losses, claims, damages, liabilities (including related expenses and settlements), with the Agent's responsibility being equal to the percentage of fees paid to them under Section 2 of this Agreement (excluding expenses) relative to the total gross proceeds received by the Holding Company from the Shares sale in the Offering. Conversely, the Blue Hills Parties' responsibility will be for the remaining portion. If such allocation is prohibited by applicable law, then each party will contribute proportionately based on their relative involvement and benefit derived from the Offering, considering factors like intent, good faith, knowledge, access to information, and opportunity to correct or prevent misstatements or omissions. The Agent's responsibility shall not exceed the total amount paid (excluding expenses) under this Agreement. This allocation mechanism is intended to ensure fairness and does not follow a pro-rata or any other method that disregards equitable considerations. Any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by an indemnified party in investigating or defending related actions, proceedings, or claims will be included in the calculation of the losses for which contribution is sought. The Agent's liability is contingent upon not exceeding the total amount paid (excluding reimbursable expenses) under this Agreement. It is understood that this limitation on the Agent's liability is crucial to the Agent's participation in this Agreement. No person found guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (as defined by Section 11(f) of the 1933 Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any other party who has not been found guilty of such misrepresentation. The obligations of the Blue Hills Parties under this Section 10 and Section 9 are in addition to any other liabilities that the Holding Company and Agent may incur. For the purposes of this Section 10, each officer, director, or person controlling the Agent or any of the Blue Hills Parties (as defined by the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act) will have the same right to seek contribution as the respective parties. Any party seeking contribution will promptly notify the other party upon receiving notice of any action, suit, claim, or proceeding for which a claim for contribution may be made under this Section 10. However, the failure to provide such notification shall not relieve the non-notifying party from any other obligations it may have hereunder or otherwise unless and to the extent the non-notifying party has been materially prejudiced through the loss of substantial rights and defenses by the other party.",
