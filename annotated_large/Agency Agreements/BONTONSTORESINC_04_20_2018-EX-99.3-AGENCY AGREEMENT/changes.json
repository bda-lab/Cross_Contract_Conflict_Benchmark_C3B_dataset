The Sale shall be conducted so that the Stores in which sales are to occur will remain open no longer than during the normal hours of operation provided for in the respective leases for the Stores.",
    "ollama_generated": "Clause:\nThe Sale will be orchestrated such that the Stores where transactions take place shall operate only within extended hours, beyond their usual lease-stipulated operational duration, should it become necessary to facilitate the smooth completion of sales during peak periods. This extension of operating hours may not exceed a total duration of 24 consecutive hours per Store, and any additional extensions will require prior written consent from the relevant property management authorities.\n\nIn addition, the property owner reserves the right to restrict or limit the number of stores participating in the Sale, should the presence of an increased number of stores within a Store cause congestion or disruption that adversely affects regular store operations or the customer experience. It is expected that all parties involved will cooperate and adhere to any guidelines or instructions provided by the property management during this period to ensure a successful Sale for all concerned.\n\nThis clause may be revised, amended, or supplemented as necessary, with approval from both parties, in order to accommodate unforeseen circumstances that may arise during the course of the Sale. The final decision on any revisions, amendments, or supplements shall rest with the property owner.",
