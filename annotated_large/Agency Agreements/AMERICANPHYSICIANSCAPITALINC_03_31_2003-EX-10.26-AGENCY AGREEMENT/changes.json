MICOA assumes responsibility for timely billing and collection of all related charges from the policyholder, with no additional obligation on the part of the business to pursue payment if invoices remain unpaid beyond agreed-upon terms.\n2. The business shall not be held liable for any outstanding balances or associated late fees resulting from inadequate communication between MICOA and the policyholder concerning billing or payments.\n3. In the event that a dispute arises regarding a charge, the policyholder must first address the matter directly with MICOA before escalating the issue to the business. The business is under no obligation to intervene in disputes involving billing between MICOA and the policyholder unless explicitly requested by MICOA.\n4. Any adjustments or refunds related to overpayments, errors, or cancellations shall be processed exclusively by MICOA and communicated directly to the policyholder, with no role for the business in this process. The business is not responsible for resolving billing-related issues arising from such adjustments or refunds.\n5. If the policyholder fails to make payments on time, the business may, at its discretion, terminate its relationship with MICOA and cease using their services, without incurring any financial liability towards outstanding balances owed to MICOA. The business will provide written notice of this decision to both the policyholder and MICOA.\n6. In case of a policyholder's bankruptcy or insolvency, the burden of proof for demonstrating that payments were made on time falls solely upon the business; however, if payment records cannot be produced, the business shall not be held liable for any outstanding balances owed to MICOA as a result.",
