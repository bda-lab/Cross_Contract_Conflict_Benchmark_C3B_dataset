In the revised clause, the obligation is shifted onto the Buyer to accept delivery within 30 days, and failure to do so will not be considered a rejection of the goods by the Buyer, implying that the Buyer may still have the right to reject the goods at a later date if they choose. This revised clause weakens the obligation on the Seller while maintaining the professional and realistic tone of the original clause.",
