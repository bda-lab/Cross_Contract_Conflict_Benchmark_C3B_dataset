This change in language may reflect a more flexible or agile approach to product development, where the final product may evolve over time based on feedback and testing. Additionally, the term \"Product Concept\" has been replaced with \"Product Inspiration,\" which is a bit more open-ended and suggests that the idea behind the product can come from various sources, not just the contractor.",
