However, any payment withheld shall be remitted to the Service Provider within a reasonable timeframe upon the Services being delivered in full and satisfactorily.

Delayed payments shall be returned to the Service Provider once the services are completed and deemed satisfactory. Nevertheless, the Service Provider remains accountable for meeting deadlines, and the Client continues to have a duty to pay for services duly provided.",
