Each Party shall be released from any liability for breach of this Agreement due to unforeseen circumstances, such as but not limited to, acts of God, transportation delays, fires, floods, earthquakes, storms, war, hostile actions by a public or private entity, social unrest, or any other events that a Party deems beyond its reasonable control. In the event that such circumstances render performance impossible, the affected Party shall be relieved from its obligations under this Agreement until the obstruction ceases; however, it shall take all reasonable measures to resume full compliance with this Agreement as soon as practicable. If the non-compliance persists for more than 60 days, the other Party retains the right to terminate this Agreement upon delivering written notice to the non-compliant Party.\n\nThis revised clause aims to lessen the obligation on a party in case of unforeseen circumstances and makes it clearer that the affected party should take reasonable steps to resume compliance as soon as possible. It also clarifies that termination can occur only if non-compliance persists for more than 60 days, rather than stating that it may be terminated after 60 days.",
