Added \"at the discretion of the instigating party\" to reflect that either party may choose which court to bring a dispute before.\n3. Restructured the clause to present the consequences (disputes being brought before certain courts) first and then the parties' obligations (consenting to jurisdiction, waiving objections, and serving process according to California law). This should make it clearer that these are the potential outcomes of a dispute rather than conditions for the agreement itself.\n4. Changed \"The parties hereto irrevocably submit to\" to \"The parties herein consent to,\" signifying that this is an act of will and can potentially be revoked in certain circumstances (although the clause still contains a waiver of objections to forum suitability, which may not be easily revoked).\n5. Changed \"Service of process shall be\" to \"Notifications of legal proceedings shall be served,\" as it is more descriptive and emphasizes that the service of process refers only to court summons or other official notifications rather than all forms of communication in the context of the agreement.",
