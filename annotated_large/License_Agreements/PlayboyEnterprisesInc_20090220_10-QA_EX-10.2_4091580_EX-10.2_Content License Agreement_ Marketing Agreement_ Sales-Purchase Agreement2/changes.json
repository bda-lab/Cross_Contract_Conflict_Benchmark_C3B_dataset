    "modified": "6. Playboy reserves the right to unilaterally modify or terminate this Contract at any time, without prior notice. Any such modifications or terminations will be binding upon the parties, provided that written confirmation is subsequently provided by an authorized representative of Playboy within a reasonable timeframe following the modification or termination. However, the failure to provide such written confirmation shall not invalidate the modification or termination itself.\n\nIn essence, this revised clause strengthens the power of Playboy to modify or terminate the contract without needing the agreement of the other party. Additionally, it shifts responsibility for providing notice of such modifications or terminations to Playboy, rather than requiring their provision beforehand as in the original clause.",

The obligation of the Seller to provide goods free of liens or encumbrances has been weakened by removing that commitment entirely.",
