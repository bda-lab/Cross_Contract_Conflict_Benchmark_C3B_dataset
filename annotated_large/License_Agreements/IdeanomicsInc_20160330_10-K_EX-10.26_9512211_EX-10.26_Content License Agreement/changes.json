The parties and the arbitration panel shall be bound to maintain the confidentiality of this Agreement, the dispute and any award, except to the extent necessary to enforce any such award. The prevailing party, if a party is so designated in the arbitration award, shall be entitled to recover from the other party its costs and fees, including attorneys\u2019 fees, associated with such arbitration. By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, the parties understand that they are waiving certain rights and protections which may otherwise be available if a dispute between the parties were determined by litigation in court, including, without limitation, the right to seek or obtain certain types of damages precluded by this arbitration provision, the right to a jury trial, certain rights of appeal, and a right to invoke formal rules of procedure and evidence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each party shall be entitled, at any time, without first resorting to the dispute resolution process set forth above, to seek injunctive or other equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, wherever such party deems appropriate, in order to preserve or enforce such party\u2019s rights hereunder.",
    "ollama_generated": "The arbitration panel will comprise three individuals, each possessing expertise in the matter at hand. All proceedings shall be conducted in English, with all submitted documents either being originally penned in English or accompanied by a certified translation in English. In the event of an arbitration award, the arbitrators will deliver a written justification to the parties involved.\n\nThe arbitration award will serve as conclusive and binding for all parties involved. The judgment on this award can be enforced in any court or tribunal with jurisdiction, and the parties hereby waive any objections to the jurisdiction of such courts due to issues like improper venue or forum non conveniens.\n\nConfidentiality is a commitment shared by both the parties and the arbitration panel concerning this Agreement, the dispute, and any awarded resolution, except in instances where confidentiality must be breached to enforce said award.\n\nThe party deemed prevailing in the arbitration shall have the right to recover from the other party costs, fees, and attorneys' fees associated with the arbitration process. By agreeing to this binding arbitration provision, parties acknowledge that they are forfeiting certain rights and protections that would typically be available if a dispute were resolved through court litigation. This includes, but is not limited to, the ability to seek or obtain specific types of damages not permitted under this arbitration clause, the right to a jury trial, certain appellate rights, and the right to apply formal rules of procedure and evidence.\n\nHowever, each party retains the option, without prior recourse to the dispute resolution process outlined above, to pursue injunctive or any equitable relief from any court of competent jurisdiction whenever they deem appropriate, to preserve or enforce their rights under this Agreement.",
