If such negotiations fail, either Party may initiate arbitration proceedings before an impartial third-party arbitrator appointed by mutual agreement or, failing that, by the American Arbitration Association. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon both Parties, except where expressly prohibited by law, and judgement thereon may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the matter.\n\nHowever, it is explicitly understood that the foregoing obligation to arbitrate does not extend to claims for injunctive relief or claims of breach of this Agreement that involve unlawful activities or potential harm to persons or property, where immediate legal action may be required for protection. In such instances, either Party shall have the right to seek appropriate remedies through the courts, without first engaging in the arbitration process set forth above.",
