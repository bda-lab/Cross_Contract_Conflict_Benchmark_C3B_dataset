The rewritten clause weakens this obligation by requiring the Depositor to obtain prior written consent from the Issuer for any transfer or assignment, and stating that any such transfer or assignment does not relieve the Depositor of its obligations under the Agreement. Additionally, it limits the rights and claims of the transferee or assignee to those held by the depositor immediately before the transfer or assignment, and explicitly states that the Issuer has no liability to any creditor, purchaser, transferee, or assignee of the Depositor arising out of this Agreement.",
