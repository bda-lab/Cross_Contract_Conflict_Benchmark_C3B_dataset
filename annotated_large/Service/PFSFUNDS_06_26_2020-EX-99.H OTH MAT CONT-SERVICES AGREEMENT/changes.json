Any tasks or additional activities undertaken by the Advisor based on this Agreement, as well as any actions performed by the Advisor for the Trust under this engagement, shall always be subject to the instructions of the Board of Trustees of the Trust.\n\nIn this revised clause, the power dynamic has slightly shifted towards the Advisor; the Trust now \"engages\" rather than \"employs\", indicating a more flexible, contractual arrangement. The Advisor's agreement to fulfill duties \"according to the provisions stated below\" also gives a subtle suggestion of increased freedom for the Advisor in how they fulfill their responsibilities. However, it still emphasizes that the Advisor must comply with the instructions of the Board of Trustees.",

This implies a slightly weaker obligation, as it does not require express consent for each additional action but assumes that the parties will comply with reasonable requests.\n2) The term \"amended\" has been changed to \"modified\" to make the language more conversational and less formal.\n3) The language emphasizing that the headings do not affect construction or effect of the Agreement remains, but the reason for their inclusion is made clearer by adding a sentence explaining that they are provided for ease of reference only.",
