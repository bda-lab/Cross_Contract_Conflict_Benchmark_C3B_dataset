PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS: Each party agrees to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement diligently and in a professional manner, using commercially reasonable efforts.\n\nREVISED PROVISION:\n\n1. PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS: Each party shall make good faith efforts to perform its respective obligations under this Agreement, but shall not be liable for any failure or delay in the performance of such obligations resulting from circumstances beyond its control.\n\nExplanation: The revised clause weakens the obligation by removing \"diligently\" and replacing \"commercially reasonable efforts\" with a more general phrase (\"good faith efforts\"). Additionally, it includes a limitation on liability for any failures or delays caused by circumstances beyond the party's control.",
