This change could be seen as a weakening of the obligation on the Distributor, as they are no longer explicitly required to meet the conditions but rather have those conditions evaluated by the Supplier. However, it is important to note that this does not absolve the Distributor from responsibility for ensuring compliance with the requirements for returns under Section 12; it simply changes who is responsible for making the final determination of compliance.",
