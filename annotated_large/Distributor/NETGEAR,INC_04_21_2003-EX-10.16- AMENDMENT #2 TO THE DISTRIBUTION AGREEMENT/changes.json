During the initial one-year period commencing on the Amendment Date, NETGEAR will solely appoint Distributor as the exclusive distributor for the designated territory, subject to both parties mutually agreeing on marketing activities as outlined in the Marketing Plan for the said territory (Exhibit 4a). This agreement considers a distributor as any entity that purchases products directly from NETGEAR for redistribution or sub-licensing to retailers or secondary resellers, who further sell or license the products to end consumers. Notwithstanding this provision, during the initial period and any subsequent times, Distributor acknowledges and accepts that NETGEAR retains the right to supply Products directly to customers within the territory, such as authorized resellers with centralized purchasing locations for direct sales to end-users through their wholly or majority owned retail outlets, both physical stores and catalogs. After the initial period, in any renewal or extension term, NETGEAR reserves the discretion to appoint additional distributors in the designated territory at its own judgment. The Distributor's status as the exclusive distributor shall become non-exclusive following the expiration of the initial one-year period.",
