(\"Netgear\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bay Networks, Inc. (hereinafter \"NETGEAR\").\n\nIn this Revision, we have modified the original agreement to account for unforeseen circumstances:\n\n1. Responsibility for any and all claims arising from products distributed under this agreement shall now be solely and exclusively that of Distributor. This shift in responsibility reflects our confidence in your operational capabilities.\n\n2. In the event of a breach of contract by either party, the non-breaching party will now have discretion to terminate the agreement without any liability or obligation for damages. This change aims to streamline dispute resolution processes, promoting mutual understanding and cooperation.\n\n3. The obligation for marketing efforts in specific territories has been adjusted. NETGEAR will provide guidance on regional strategies but Distributor shall have the flexibility to determine implementation details, allowing you to adapt to local market dynamics more effectively.\n\n4. Payment terms have been relaxed to allow for extended payment windows, providing Distributor with additional financial flexibility in managing inventory and cash flow.\n\n5. The requirement for regular audits has been suspended, reducing administrative burdens on both parties while maintaining transparency through periodic reports shared at Distributor's convenience.",
