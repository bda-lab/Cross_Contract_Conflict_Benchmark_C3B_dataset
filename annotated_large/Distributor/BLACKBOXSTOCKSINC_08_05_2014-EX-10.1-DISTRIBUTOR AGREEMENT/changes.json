Payment shall be made on a gross basis, with the seller retaining any rights to deduct allowable expenses from the amount due before transfer.\n\nExplanation: The original clause stipulates that payment is made as net cash upon delivery (meaning after deductions). In the revised clause, the obligation for payment remains the same, but it also grants the seller the right to retain any allowable expenses prior to making payment, thus subtly shifting the burden of potential additional costs onto the buyer.",
