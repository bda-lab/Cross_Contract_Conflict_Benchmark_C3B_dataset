For products where there is no separate line item for the Software (i.e. the prices for both the Hardware and Software are bundled), and therefore, a fee cannot be determined, an exception will be made to allow for the transfer without the customer being required to obtain a new license (the customer may be required to pay an inspection fee), if (A) Software to be transferred (i) will be under a support contract provided by either Cisco or a Cisco\u200b\u2010 authorized support partner or (ii) is still supported by Cisco\u037e or (B) approval from the theatre Sales Controller has been obtained.",

Unless explicitly permitted in our contract or under the listed exceptions, any transfers will necessitate a new license fee (refer to the Global Price List). For products where the Software cost is bundled with the Hardware price, an exception may be granted for transfer without the necessity of obtaining a new license, although a reasonable inspection fee may apply. This exemption is permitted in two scenarios:\n\n1. The Software to be transferred falls under a support contract provided by Cisco or an authorized Cisco support partner.\n2. The Software to be transferred continues to be supported by Cisco or an approved Cisco support partner. Alternatively, approval from the Theatre Sales Controller must be obtained for any transfers not explicitly permitted under our contract or the listed exceptions.",
