ZEBRATECH INTERNATIONAL, LLC (hereinafter \"Contracting Parties\")\n\nIn the event of any dispute arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, the Contracting Parties shall first engage in good faith negotiations to resolve such dispute amicably. If the dispute remains unresolved after thirty (30) days from the commencement of the negotiation process, either party may submit the matter for resolution through binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC), with the seat of arbitration being New York City, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon by both parties. In this case, each Contracting Party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses related to the arbitration process, except that the arbitrator may award costs and attorney's fees to the prevailing party if deemed appropriate in the final arbitral decision.\n\nPreviously:\n\nZEBRA TECHNOLOGIES INTERNATIONAL, LLC SCANSOURCE, INC.\n\nIn any dispute arising out of or in relation to this Agreement, the parties shall first attempt in good faith to settle such dispute by negotiation. If the parties fail to resolve the dispute through negotiation within thirty (30) days from the commencement of negotiations, either party may terminate this Agreement and institute legal proceedings against the other for resolution. In this event, each party shall bear its own attorneys' fees and expenses associated with such legal proceedings. The court having jurisdiction over the parties shall apply the laws of the state where SCANSOURCE, INC. is domiciled, provided that if a dispute arises relating to an agreement between the parties outside of this Agreement, the governing law shall be the law of the jurisdiction in which such agreement was entered into.\n\nThe main differences in these clauses are:\n1. In the rewritten clause, both parties agree to pursue binding arbitration instead of terminating the agreement and pursuing legal proceedings. This means that the obligation to resolve disputes through litigation has been weakened.\n2. The rewritten clause stipulates that each party shall bear its own legal fees and expenses related to the arbitration process, whereas in the original clause, each party would bear their own costs for any legal proceedings initiated as a result of a dispute. This means that the responsibility for legal expenses has been shifted from one party to both parties.\n3. The venue for arbitration is specified as New York City in the rewritten clause, while the original clause did not specify a specific location unless mutually agreed upon by the parties or determined by the court with jurisdiction over the dispute.",
