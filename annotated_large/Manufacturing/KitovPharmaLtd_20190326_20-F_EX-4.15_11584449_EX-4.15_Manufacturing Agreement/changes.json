The Parties shall exchange, free of charge, any documentation received from the third party filing the IP Claim, and shall also send each other copies of the documents issued by any of them, regarding such IP Claim.",

This includes, but is not limited to, any claims, demands, awards, or damages.\n\nUpon receipt of such information, the Parties shall promptly share all relevant documents received from the third party asserting the IP Potential Issue, at their own expense. Additionally, each Party agrees to provide copies of any correspondence or documentation issued by them, in relation to such IP Potential Issues, to the other Party without delay.\n\nIn this revised clause, the Parties' obligation to inform each other has been rephrased as an acknowledgment of a mutual obligation. The Parties are now required to disclose \"potential\" infringement issues rather than confirmed IP claims, and they have been relieved from the obligation to exchange documents \"free of charge.\" Instead, they are now responsible for sharing relevant documents at their own expense.",
