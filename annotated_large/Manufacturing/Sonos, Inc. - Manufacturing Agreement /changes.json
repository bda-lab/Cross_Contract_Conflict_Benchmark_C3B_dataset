However, it is important to note that the overall intention and purpose of the clause remain the same: to establish a method for assessing the Supplier's performance.\n\nHere is an example of how this revised clause could be used in a contract:\n\n\"The Client will appoint an independent evaluator to conduct regular reviews of the Supplier's performance based on the agreed metrics specified in F.2 (Metrics for Evaluating Supplier Performance). The evaluator's findings will be shared with both parties, and any necessary adjustments will be made accordingly.\"",
