As of April 1, 2018 and continuing until Cerus determines, in its sole discretion, that the Protocol EPP-029-886 under which Porex is currently operating can be discontinued, the price for Platelet Wafers shall be the prices set forth in Exhibit D-1. Upon Cerus\u2019 determination that the Protocol EPP-029- 886 can be discontinued, Cerus shall provide written notice thereof to Porex, along with a new purchase order for Platelet Wafers (the \u201cNew Pricing PO\u201d). On and after the date of such notice, the \u201cPricing\u201d table for Platelet Wafers in Exhibit D, as of the date immediately preceding the date of this Amendment, shall be reinstated and apply to Platelet Wafers that are produced pursuant to the New Pricing PO and were also produced after the date of the written notice.

Once Cerus decides that the Protocol EPP-029-886 can be terminated, Cerus shall deliver written notice to Porex and a new purchase order for Platelet Wafers (the \"New Pricing PO\"). Following the date of such notification, the \"Pricing\" table for Platelet Wafers in Exhibit D, as it existed prior to the effective date of this Amendment, will be reinstated and will apply to Platelet Wafers produced in accordance with the New Pricing PO and after the written notice has been delivered. References in Section 1.5.1 of the Agreement to \"Exhibit D\" shall now encompass \"Exhibit D-1,\" as appropriate.\n\nIn this revised clause, I have shifted the responsibility for the price change back to Cerus by stating that they will reinstate the previous pricing table upon their own determination to terminate the Protocol EPP-029-886. Additionally, I used \"can no longer be maintained\" instead of \"can be discontinued\" to weaken the obligation slightly, implying that there may be factors preventing the Protocol from being completely ceased.",
