    "ollama_generated": "Contract Provision: Obligation for Appropriate Measures in the Protection of Vertebrate Animal Subjects\n\nThe PHYS Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals expects that applicant organizations, whether domestic or foreign, will submit a written Animal Welfare Assurance to the Office for Laboratory Animal Welfare (OLAW), outlining suitable policies and procedures to guarantee the humane treatment of live vertebrate animals participating in research activities supported by the PHS. The onus lies with the applicant organization to ensure the ethical treatment of animals in PHS-funded research projects. As per the PHS Policy, an \"animal\" is defined as any living, vertebrate creature intended for use in research, training, experimentation, biological testing, or related activities.\n\nThis policy serves to uphold and supplement the U.S. Government Principles for the Utilization and Care of Vertebrate Animals Used in Testing, Research, and Training. Institutions are advised to base their animal care and use programs on the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.\n\nHowever, this policy does not supersede any more rigorous state or local laws and regulations concerning the handling of laboratory animals. All institutions must adhere, as necessary, to the Animal Welfare Act, as amended, and other pertinent federal statutes and regulations regarding animal care. The relevant documents for these requirements can be obtained from the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD 20892, (301) 496-7163. http://grants.nih.gov/grants/olaw/olaw.htm.\n\nIn this revised version, the responsibility for ensuring humane treatment of animals has been shifted from the PHS to the applicant organization, and the clause now outlines expectations rather than requirements.",
