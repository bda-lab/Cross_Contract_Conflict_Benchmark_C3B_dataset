The term \"Force Majeure\" means one or a set of circumstances such as an act of God, strike, lockout or other industrial disturbances, act of the  public enemy, war, terrorism, blockade, riot, lightning, fire, storm, freezing, flood, explosion, governmental action, delay, restraint or inaction (whether  said government's jurisdiction or authority be actual or assumed), including  without limitation, governmental action or inaction relating to the permitting  of wells, and any other cause, circumstance or condition (except financial)  whether of the kind herein enumerated or otherwise, not reasonably within the  control of the Party claiming Force Majeure.

Upon providing prompt written notice detailing the Exempting Event to the other Party within a reasonable timeframe, the affected Party shall not be liable for any non-performance during the duration of the Exempting Event. The Party claiming the exemption is expected to take all reasonable measures to mitigate and remedy the effects of the Exempting Event as soon as practicable.\n\nThe term \"Exempting Events\" encompasses occurrences such as an act of God, strike, lockout or other industrial disturbances, act of public enemy, war, terrorism, blockade, riot, lightning, fire, storm, freezing, flood, explosion, governmental action, delay, restraint, or inaction (whether the governing authority is actual or assumed), including but not limited to governmental actions or inactions relating to the permitting of wells, and any other cause, circumstance, or condition (except financial) that is not reasonably within the control of the Party claiming exemption.\n\nThe expectation for prompt resolution of strikes, lockouts, or labor difficulties shall not require the conceding to the demands of opposing parties in such disputes when doing so would be inadvisable at the discretion of the Party claiming exemption from its obligations.",
