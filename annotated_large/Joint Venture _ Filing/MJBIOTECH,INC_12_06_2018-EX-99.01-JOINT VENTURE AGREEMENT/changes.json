However, it is understood that in the event of unforeseen circumstances beyond the control of either Party (e.g., natural disasters, changes in laws or regulations), the Party affected shall not be deemed to have breached this Understanding and shall not be liable for any losses sustained by the joint venture as a result thereof.\n\nThis Understanding constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties regarding the formation and operation of the joint venture and supersedes all prior oral or written communications, representations, or understandings relating to such subject matter.
