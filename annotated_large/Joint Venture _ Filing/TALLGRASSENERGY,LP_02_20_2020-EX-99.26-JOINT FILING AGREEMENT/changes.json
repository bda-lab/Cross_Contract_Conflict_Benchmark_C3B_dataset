    "ollama_generated": "FOR THE RECORD, the parties hereto hereby acknowledge their execution of this Joint Filing Agreement effective as of February 19, 2020.\n\nExplanation: The original clause uses \"IN WITNESS WHEREOF\" to denote that the agreement is being made in the presence of a witness or witnesses, indicating the seriousness and formality of the contract. In the rewritten clause, I have changed this phrase to \"FOR THE RECORD,\" which suggests a more informal, casual approach while still maintaining professionalism. This subtle change in language can make the agreement appear less binding, potentially benefiting the parties who wish to present a less formal image or negotiate more favorable terms.",
