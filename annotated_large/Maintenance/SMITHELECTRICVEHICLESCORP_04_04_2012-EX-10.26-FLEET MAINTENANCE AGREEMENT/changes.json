In case of email communication, it shall be treated as received when the recipient acknowledges receipt, or if no acknowledgement is received, upon the expiration of 12 hours following transmission during business hours.\n\n32.2  Should a notice arrive outside of standard business hours (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM, Monday through Friday, excluding bank holidays), it shall be deemed delivered on the next ensuing business day. Any party failing to acknowledge receipt of a given notice within a reasonable timeframe should not rely on any information, representations or statements contained therein unless expressly agreed otherwise in writing by the respective parties.\n\nIn this revised clause, the original provision of communication being received 48 hours after posting for domestic delivery and 72 hours for international postage has been adjusted to allow for a slightly longer timeframe (now 72 hours for domestic delivery and 96 hours for international postage). Additionally, the responsibility of acknowledging receipt of notices sent via email has been shifted to the recipient.",
