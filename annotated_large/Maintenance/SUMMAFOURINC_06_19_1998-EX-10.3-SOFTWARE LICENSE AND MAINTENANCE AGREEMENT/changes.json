Limitation of Liability: In no event shall the Licensor be liable for any damages, whether direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary, arising out of or in connection with the use or inability to use the Software, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of such damages. The Licensee assumes all risks associated with the use of the Software.\n\n5. Term and Termination: This Agreement shall commence on the Effective Date (as defined in Exhibit A) and shall continue until terminated by either party upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the other party. Upon termination, the Licensee must cease all use of the Software and return or destroy all copies thereof in its possession.\n\nIn this revised clause, the obligation on the end user (Licensee) to notify D2 Technologies (Licensor) before terminating the agreement has been weakened by allowing either party to terminate upon thirty (30) days' written notice to the other party. This change favors the Licensee, who now has more flexibility in terminating the agreement without needing prior approval from the Licensor.",

This strategy is acceptable in a pure digit-in-voice-out scenario, but for voice conferencing or voice recognition applications, voice could be present in the both the transmit and receive path.
