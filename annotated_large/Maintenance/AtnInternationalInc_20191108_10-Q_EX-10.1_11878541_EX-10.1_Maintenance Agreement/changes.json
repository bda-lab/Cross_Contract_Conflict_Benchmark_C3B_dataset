The original clause 4.23 mentions safety management as an exclusive obligation of ATN International, Inc. The rewritten clause allows for non-exclusive safety management, which means that other parties may also be responsible for safety management.\n2. The original clause 4.24 mentions technical support as a requirement. The rewritten clause makes it optional, meaning that ATN International, Inc. is not obligated to provide technical support if they choose not to.\n3. The original clause 4.25 mentions testimony as a binding obligation. The rewritten clause makes it non-binding, which means that testimony provided by ATN International, Inc. does not legally obligate the company.\n4. The original clause 4.26 mentions the use of AT&T Data and AT&T Derived Data as restricted. The rewritten clause allows for permissive use, meaning that ATN International, Inc. may use this data at their discretion.\n5. The original clause 4.27 mentions business continuity plan as a responsibility of both parties. The rewritten clause shifts this responsibility to the vendor.\n6. The original clause 4.28 mentions change in laws as an obligation of both parties to comply. The rewritten clause makes it an obligation of ATN International, Inc. to notify the other party about any changes in laws.\n7. The original clause 5.1 and 5.2 mention that the agreement must be executed with original signatures and multiple counterparts cannot be used unless explicitly stated. The rewritten clause allows for electronic signatures and the use of multiple counterparts is not required.\n8. The original clause states that the agreement and information contained therein should not be disclosed outside of certain parties without a written agreement from both contracting parties. The rewritten clause permits disclosure with the prior written consent of both parties.",

Should AT&T fail to scrutinize the provided certificate of insurance, or overlook a potential deficiency, it shall not be interpreted as a relinquishment by Vendor of their duty to preserve the insurance mandated under this Agreement.\n\n2. The insurance mandated within this Agreement does not guarantee that the coverage and limits will suffice for Vendor's protection; nor should it be perceived as restricting Vendor's accountability towards AT&T under this Agreement.\n\n3. Vendor holds the prerogative to fulfill the required insurance coverages and limits through any combination of primary and Umbrella/Excess liability policies, at their discretion.\n\n4. It is incumbent upon Vendor to bear responsibility for any deductible or self-insured retention associated with the aforementioned insurance policies.\n\nIn this revised clause, the obligation on Vendor to maintain insurance remains unchanged, but the second part subtly suggests that the insurance may not provide adequate protection for Vendor, and it does not limit their liability towards AT&T. This subtle shift in phrasing may create a perception of potential risk that wasn't as clear in the original clause.",
