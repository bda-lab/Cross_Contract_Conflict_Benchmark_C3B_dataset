The non-breaching party may recover only the direct damages caused by the breach, and any consequential or indirect damages are expressly waived (Clause 9.2).\n\nIn contrast, this Agreement places a conditional obligation on the parties to mitigate their losses resulting from a breach or non-performance (Clause 9.3), rather than an absolute duty as previously stated. In the event of a breach or non-performance by either party, each party shall employ reasonable efforts to reduce any losses arising therefrom, to the extent practicable under the circumstances. The failure of a party to mitigate its losses does not constitute a waiver of the right to recover damages for such breach or non-performance (Clause 9.4).",

This change could potentially imply that the obligations or responsibilities between the parties are more informal or goodwill-based, depending on the context of the rest of the contract.",

This action may be initiated if AIG does not promptly address or refuses to act upon the Company's rights as outlined in paragraphs 1, 4, and 5 within a reasonable timeframe, or fails to fulfill any claim or payment owed to such policyholder when due.
