Specifically, this Revision modifies Section 7.3(c) of the Agreement as follows:\n\nIn place of the existing obligation on the Partnership to maintain the Sagebrush property at a standard deemed acceptable by Manager, the Partnership's maintenance obligations shall now be subject to Manager's approval, with Manager bearing sole responsibility for determining the standard of maintenance for the Sagebrush property. This modification is intended to streamline the maintenance process and reduce potential disputes regarding the maintenance standard.\n\nThe Partners acknowledge and agree that this Revision constitutes a material amendment to the Agreement and that each Partner is bound by its terms. The Manager agrees to implement this Revision promptly upon execution, and any further modifications or amendments to the Agreement must be agreed upon in writing by all parties.",
