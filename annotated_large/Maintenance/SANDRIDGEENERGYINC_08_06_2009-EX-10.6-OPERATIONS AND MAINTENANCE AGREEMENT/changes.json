    "modified": "8.4.1 Operator's Counter-Indemnification: Subsubject to the provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited to Section 9.7 of this Agreement, the Operator Indemnified Parties shall be indemnified, defended, and held harmless by the Owner from and against all claims and losses arising out of or relating to (i) allegations of death or bodily injury or damage to property, to the extent these arise from or result from the negligence, gross negligence, or willful misconduct of the Operator Indemnified Parties, their respective officers, directors, employees, or contractors in connection with this Agreement or the performance hereof; provided that the Owner shall not be required to indemnify the Operator Indemnified Parties against such claims and losses to the extent such claims and losses are attributable to the acts or omissions of Owner, its affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, employees, or contractors. However, the duty to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless under this Section 8.4.1 shall not extend to claims and losses arising from any breach of this Agreement by the Operator Indemnified Parties, or any agreements relating to the gathering system between Owner and third parties affiliated with the Operator Parties. This obligation to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless under this Section 8.4.1 shall survive the expiration or early termination of this Agreement, with respect to any claims or losses based on facts or conditions that occurred prior to such expiration or termination.\n\nIn essence, this clause has been rewritten to slightly shift the responsibility for certain claims and losses from the Owner to the Operator Indemnified Parties. The changes include the use of \"counter-indemnification\" instead of \"Owner's indemnification,\" and the inclusion of a phrase that limits the Operator Indemnified Parties' indemnification from claims arising from their own breach of the Agreement or agreements related to the gathering system with non-affiliated third parties. The clause also specifies that the Operator Indemnified Parties will not be required to indemnify the Owner for claims and losses attributable to the actions of the Owner, its affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, employees, or contractors. Lastly, the clause has been rephrased to ensure it continues to apply even after the expiration or early termination of the Agreement.",
