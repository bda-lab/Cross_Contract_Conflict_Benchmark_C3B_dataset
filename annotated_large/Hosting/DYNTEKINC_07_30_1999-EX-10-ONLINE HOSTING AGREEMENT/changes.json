Diplomat may, at its own expense, examine and copy those books and records as provided in this Section 4. Such books, records and accounts will be maintained in a manner that allows Diplomat to separate these matters from those relating to Tadeo's other operations. Such books, records and accounts will reflect such information as would normally be examined by an independent accountant in performing an audit pursuant to United States generally accepted auditing standards for the purpose of certifying financial statements, and to permit verification thereof by governmental agencies. Diplomat may make examinations pursuant hereto during Tadeo's usual business hours, and at the place in the continental United States where Tadeo regularly keeps these books and records. Diplomat will be required to notify Tadeo at least five business days before the date of planned examination. If Diplomat's examination is not completed within one month from commencement, Tadeo at any time may require Diplomat to terminate such examination on seven days' notice to Diplomat\u037e PROVIDED that Tadeo has cooperated with Diplomat in the examination of such books and records.",

At its own expense, Diplomat possesses the right to inspect these documents as outlined in Section 4. These records must be organized in a way that enables Diplomat to distinguish them from those associated with Tadeo's other activities. The books, records, and accounts shall contain all necessary details typically scrutinized by an independent auditor during an audit in accordance with the United States generally accepted auditing standards, intended for certifying financial statements and facilitating verification by governmental agencies.\n\nDiplomat may conduct these inspections during Tadeo's normal business hours at the continental U.S. location where Tadeo regularly keeps these records. Diplomat must notify Tadeo at least five business days prior to the proposed examination date. If Diplomat fails to complete its examination within one month from initiation, Tadeo retains the authority to request Diplomat to cease the examination after providing a seven-day notice to Diplomat, regardless of whether or not Tadeo has cooperated with Diplomat during the examination process.",
