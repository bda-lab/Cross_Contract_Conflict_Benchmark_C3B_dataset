Critical Priority (P1): An immediate response is required due to the substantial impact on your service or business operations. This includes incidents that could cause a data loss or significant financial harm if not resolved promptly. In this case, our support team will respond within 15 minutes and resolve the incident as soon as possible.\n\n2. High Priority (P2): A timely response is essential to minimize service disruption or potential impact on your business operations. This includes incidents that may cause inconvenience or significant operational slowdown. Our support team will respond within 4 hours, aiming for resolution within 8 hours of the incident being reported.\n\n3. Normal Priority (P3): While these incidents do not pose an immediate threat to service continuity, they still require attention and should be addressed in a timely manner. This includes minor issues or requests for information or configuration changes. Our support team will respond within 24 hours, aiming for resolution within 72 hours of the incident being reported.\n\n4. Low Priority (P4): These incidents can typically wait for resolution during regular business hours and do not require an immediate response. This includes general inquiries or issues that do not impact service delivery. Our support team will respond within 3 business days, aiming for resolution within a week of the incident being reported.",
