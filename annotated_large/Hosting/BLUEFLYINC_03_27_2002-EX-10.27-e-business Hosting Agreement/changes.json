(Host) and Client (Service Provider):\n\nUnder this agreement, the Service Provider shall provide e-business hosting services to the Host on the terms and conditions set forth below, recognizing that the Host shall have ultimate discretion over all aspects of the hosted service's management and operation.\n\nThe Service Provider agrees to make reasonable efforts to maintain the uptime of the hosted service, but acknowledges that downtime may occur due to unforeseen circumstances beyond its control. The Host accepts no responsibility for any resulting damages or losses arising from such downtime.\n\nFurthermore, while the Host encourages Service Providers to prioritize regular updates and maintenance, it is the responsibility of the Service Provider to ensure that the hosted service remains secure, functional, and up-to-date at all times. The Host reserves the right to suspend or terminate the hosting services in the event that the Service Provider fails to comply with its obligations under this agreement or if the hosted service becomes a risk or liability to the Host.\n\nThe Host shall not be held liable for any direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or exemplary damages resulting from the use of the hosted service by the Service Provider or third parties, except in cases where such damages are caused by the Host's gross negligence or willful misconduct.\n\nThe Host and Service Provider acknowledge that this agreement constitutes the entire understanding between them regarding the hosting services, superseding any prior agreements, representations, or understandings. Any amendments to this agreement must be in writing and signed by both parties. This agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to its conflict of law principles.\n\nBy executing this agreement, each party represents that it has the authority to enter into this agreement on behalf of itself or its affiliates. In the event that any provision of this agreement is deemed unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction, the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect. The failure of either party to enforce any provision of this agreement shall not constitute a waiver of that provision or any other provision.\n\nIn the event of a dispute arising out of or related to this agreement, the parties shall attempt to resolve the matter through good faith negotiations. If such negotiations fail, either party may initiate binding arbitration in accordance with the Rules of Arbitration of the American Arbitration Association. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding upon both parties.\n\nThis Hosting Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.",
