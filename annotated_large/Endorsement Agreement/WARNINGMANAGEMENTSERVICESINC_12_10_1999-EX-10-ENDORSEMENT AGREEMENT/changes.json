    "modified": "(c)   \"Contract Year Quarter\" shall refer to each non-overlapping period of four months within any Contract Term (\"Contract Term\" denoting the entire duration of this agreement, with the first Contract Term starting from the commencement date herein and continuing thereafter in twelve month increments, such that the first Contract Term Quarter starts on June 1 of the effective year). Consequently, for illustrative purposes, the first Contract Term Quarter in the inaugural Contract Term would begin on June 1, 1999, the second on October 1, 1999, and so forth. This definition allows for a slight difference in interpretation: rather than having three consecutive months, the quarters now consist of four months each, with a new quarter starting every fourth month from the start date.",
