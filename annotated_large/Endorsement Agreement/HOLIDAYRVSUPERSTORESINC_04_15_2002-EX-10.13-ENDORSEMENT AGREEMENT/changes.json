AGI warrants that it has the right and ability to grant the License to the Company to use the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and, provided that the Company uses the Trademarks for the Approved Use in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such grant will not infringe upon the rights of any other party. If the Company promptly notifies AGI in writing of a third party claim against the Company alleging that the Company's use of the Trademarks infringes a United States registered trademark, and if such claim of infringement is not caused in whole or in part by the Company having used the Trademarks other than for the Approved Use or other than strictly in the manner approved by AGI in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, AGI will defend such claim at its expense and will indemnify the Company, its agents and representatives, for all losses, claims, charges, costs and expenses incurred by the Company as a result of such claim. The Company hereby agrees to reimburse and indemnify and hold AGI harmless from and against all losses, claims, charges, costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by AGI as a result of any claim involving or arising in connection with any use other than an Approved Use or a use otherwise approved by AGI in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.",

The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless AGI from any claims arising from uses of the Trademarks that do not conform to the Approved Use or are not otherwise approved by AGI in accordance with this Agreement's terms, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by AGI as a result.",
