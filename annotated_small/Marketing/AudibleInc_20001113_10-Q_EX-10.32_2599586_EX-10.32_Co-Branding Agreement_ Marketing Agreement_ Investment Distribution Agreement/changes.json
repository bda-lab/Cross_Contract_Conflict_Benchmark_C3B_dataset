This Agreement shall take effect on the Effective Date, and it shall continue in force unless terminated by either party with written notice at any time prior to the conclusion of Year 3. Following the expiration of Year 3, this Agreement will be deemed automatically renewed on a yearly basis, subject to either party's right to terminate upon providing written notice.\n\nIn this revised clause, the original clause stated that the agreement would end automatically at the end of Year 3 unless terminated elsewhere in the agreement. In contrast, the revised clause provides that the agreement will continue unless terminated by either party with written notice prior to Year 3, and if not terminated, it will be automatically renewed annually after Year 3. This new version shifts the responsibility for termination from the unspecified \"elsewhere\" in the original clause to either party as of the revised clause. Additionally, while the original clause implied that the agreement would end after three years with no possibility of renewal, the revised clause allows for an automatic yearly renewal unless terminated by either party.",

Attempt to update the Customer's billing information by using alternative payment methods or contacting their bank or financial institution for assistance, as long as such actions do not require Amazon Music to incur additional costs beyond those normally associated with customer service.\n3.

Maintain records of all communications and actions taken related to this clause for potential use in any future disputes or litigation arising from unpaid fees or charges. Amazon Music will make these records available upon reasonable request by the Customer, subject to applicable privacy laws and regulations.",
