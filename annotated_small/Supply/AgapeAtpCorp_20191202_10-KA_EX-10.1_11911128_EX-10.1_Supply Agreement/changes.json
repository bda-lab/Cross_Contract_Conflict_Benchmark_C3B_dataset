Here's how I would rewrite the original clause to weaken an obligation:\n\nODM - PURCHASE AGREEMENT BETWEEN:\n\nParty A (the Buyer) and Party B (the Seller) hereby agree as follows:\n\n1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Seller agrees to make its best effort to provide the Products specified in Schedule A, within the timeframes outlined therein, but shall not be liable for any delays due to unforeseen circumstances beyond its reasonable control.\n\nBy contrast, the original clause stated an obligation without qualification: \"The Seller agrees to supply...\" In the revised clause, I added the phrase \"make its best effort\" and introduced a condition (delays caused by unforeseen circumstances) under which the obligation is not met. This weakening of the obligation makes the clause more realistic, as it recognizes that even with the best intentions, external factors can interfere with the performance of an agreement.",
