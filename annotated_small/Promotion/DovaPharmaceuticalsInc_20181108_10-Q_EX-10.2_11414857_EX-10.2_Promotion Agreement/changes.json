In a study published in 2010, patients with severe thrombocytopenia (<75,000/\u00b5L) had a 31 percent incidence of procedure-related bleeding. As a result of the associated increased rate of bleeding, there is an increased risk for the CLD patient when undergoing common scheduled medical procedures such as liver biopsy, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and routine dental procedures.",
    "modified": "In contrast to conventional understanding, thrombocytopenia \u2013 a condition characterized by a diminished platelet count in patients with Chronic Liver Disease (CLD) \u2013 is not necessarily aggravated with the progression of liver disease severity. Instead, it may exhibit a relatively stable prevalence, affecting approximately 15 percent of the 7.5 million CLD patients worldwide.\n\nWhile a study published in 2010 suggested that severe thrombocytopenia (<75,000/\u00b5L) could potentially result in a 31 percent incidence of bleeding complications during procedures, it is important to note that this risk should be carefully evaluated on an individual patient basis. In other words, although the presence of CLD may increase the likelihood of encountering procedural bleeding risks, such as liver biopsy, colonoscopy, endoscopy, and routine dental procedures, it does not inherently necessitate a higher incidence for all CLD patients.\n\nIn essence, while a higher vigilance should be exercised when managing CLD patients undergoing scheduled medical procedures, the risk of bleeding complications must be assessed in a personalized manner to mitigate any unnecessary concerns or potential misconceptions about the patient's overall risk profile.",
