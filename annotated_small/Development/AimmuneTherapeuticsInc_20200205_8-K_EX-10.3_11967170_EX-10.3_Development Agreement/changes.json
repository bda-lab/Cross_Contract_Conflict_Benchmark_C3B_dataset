It is worth noting that Aimmune has secured FDA approval for a medicine targeting peanut allergy, and continues to explore additional therapeutic options to manage other food allergies. For comprehensive insights, kindly visit www.aimmune.com.\n\nChanges made:\n1. The focus of the company's aspiration was changed from becoming the \"global leader\" to seeking to assert \"leadership on a global scale.\" This weakens the obligation of becoming a definitive market leader, but still indicates an ambition for leadership.\n2. The original clause mentioned that Aimmune is developing and commercializing therapies, while the revised version mentions it is \"dedicated to the development and commercialization\" of these therapies. This implies a stronger commitment towards this task, but does not necessarily guarantee success.\n3. In the original clause, Aimmune's Characterized Oral Desensitization ImmunoTherapy (CODIT \u2122) approach was intended to provide \"meaningful levels of protection\" against allergic reactions. The revised version states that it aims to offer \"substantial protection,\" suggesting a higher level of efficacy, although the exact meaning remains subjective.\n4. In the original clause, Aimmune has \"one FDA-approved medicine for peanut allergy and other investigational therapies in development to treat other food allergies.\" The revised version mentions that it has secured FDA approval for a medicine targeting peanut allergy, and continues to explore additional therapeutic options to manage other food allergies. This implies that the company is actively working on other treatments but does not guarantee their success or availability in the market.",
